# webcam_pub
Ros2 lib to search for a certain video input by the name, open video with opencv and publish it

in my case its the MicrosoftÂ® LifeCam Studio(TM). 

Created this package because i have multiple cameras installed and want to get the input of a certain one without having to disconnect the others.

ONLY TESTED ON UBUNTU!
